## About me

With over 8 years of experience conceptualising and designing various print and digital media, as well as 5 years experience developing, building and maintaining complex websites. I have helped companies reach their goals in various industries such as advertising, media and financial sectors. When I am not building websites and learning new things, I am tinkering away with my 3d printer and make things. Using my strong background in design, I enjoy bringing creativity into the development process and I am always keen to learn more as well as share my knowledge along the way.
