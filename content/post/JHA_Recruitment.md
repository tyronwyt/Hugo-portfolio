JHA Recruitment's website was rebranded and designed and built to meet their growing needs.

<!--more-->
JHA Recruitment required a CMS base website that they could login and add, remove and update job listings. Using WordPress the site allows users to browse existing job listings available and apply on the site. Recruiters also have the ability to update and edit job listings, add new listings as well as remove them once a role has been filled.
