I was tasked to rebrand and develop a wide array of S&P Global's marketing materials, ranging from email templates to lead generating landing pages.
The main requirements were that these pages needed to be modular, templated and responsive all while degrading gracefully on older/less popular browsers and clients. The landing page templates were designed and built using the company's newly released style guide setup with Sass and new functional additions added for better usability.
