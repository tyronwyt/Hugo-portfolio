At VIVID Travel I was the sole frontend developer responsible for the UI and development of the website. I brought new ideas forward to improve engagement, optimise performance and develop new features. I worked alongside the directors and marketers to assess the companies goals and work out plans and roadmaps on achieving them. I was responsible for designing wireframes and mockups and present them to the wider company and also document new features. The website runs on [Umbraco CMS](https://umbraco.com/). I dabbled in a bit of backend development to setup new components following the MVC Architecture.

I also was responsible for designing other digital assets, wireframes, mockups, print signage, and email templates.
